    "You may not know this, but the salaries of the employees at the University of Illinois are publicly available! We have curated this data in a nice, structured dataset called `graybook.csv` for you to explore.  The goal of this lab is to work with real UIUC salary data to explore its properties, answer important questions, and to think about the implications of collecting and analyzing this data.  Throughout the lab, it is important to think about being a critical consumer of data who can not only use statistics and programming to analyze data but can also think about the \"why\" part of data science both in the classroom and in the world. Let’s get started!\n",

    "- Work with real UIUC salary data to explore some of the statistics that we talked about in class: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.\n",
    "- Practice creating plots to visualize quantitative data: boxplots and histograms.\n",
