    "- Since there are 140 different departments in the dataset, the default size will look very cramped. Use parameters to alter the `figsize` of the bar chart and make the graph cleaner.\n",
    "- You will also have to specify the columns you want for your x and y axes.\n",
    "    - However, since we aggregated the dataframe, the `mean` column is a sub-column under `salary` so it's a bit harder to access.   We'll have to use a special selection method called **MultiIndexing**. The format to access a sub-column is the following:\n",
